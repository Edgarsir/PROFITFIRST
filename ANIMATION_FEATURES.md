# ðŸŽ¨ Website Animation Features

## âœ… **Implemented Animations**

### **1. Hero Section**

### **2. Who Can Benefit Section**
- **Section fades in when scrolled into view**
- **Each row slides in alternately from left and right**
- **Hover effects on all content cards** (scale + glow + background change)
- **Hover effects on all images** (scale up + rotation)
- **Animated CTA button** with hover/tap effects

### **3. Key Benefits Section**
- **Container scales up with fade-in effect**
- **Benefit cards pop in with rotation animation** (from -180Â° to 0Â°)
- **Sequential animation delays** for each card (0.2s intervals)
- **Hover effects**: scale + rotation + shadow on each card
- **Central illustration** with hover scale and rotation

### **4. How It Works Section**
- **Fade and slide-up on scroll**
- **Each step card animates in sequentially** with delays
- **Step 1**: Slides from left with hover scale + glow
- **Step 2**: Slides from bottom with hover effects
- **Step 3**: Slides from right with hover animations
- **Step 4**: Slides from bottom with image hover effects
- **Step 5**: Slides from right with earnings card animations
- **All buttons have hover/tap effects** (scale + glow)

### **5. Calculator Section**
- **Split animation**: Input form slides from left, results from right
- **Earnings cards animate in sequentially**
- **All buttons have hover/tap effects** (scale + glow)
- **Smooth transitions** on all interactive elements

### **6. Reviews Section**
- **Left column reviews slide in from left with rotation**
- **Right column reviews slide in from right with rotation**
- **All review cards have hover effects** (scale + shadow + lift)
- **Staggered animation timing** for natural flow (0.15s intervals)
- **Enhanced hover effects** with green glow accents

### **7. FAQ Section**
- **FAQ cards slide in from right with slight rotation**
- **Hover effects on each FAQ item** (scale + background change)
- **Left section content slides in from left**
- **Smooth expand/collapse animations** with spring physics
- **Animated chevron rotation** on expand/collapse

### **8. Enhanced Section Transitions**
- **Smoother fade-in with slide-up** when sections come into view
- **Viewport-based animations** (trigger when 120px from view)
- **Once-only animations** to prevent re-triggering on scroll
- **Enhanced timing** across all sections (0.8s duration with easeOut)
- **Global smooth scroll** behavior with CSS and JavaScript

## ðŸŽ¯ **Animation Features**

### **Scroll-triggered Animations**
- Sections animate in once when scrolled into view (no re-triggering)
- Uses enhanced Intersection Observer for performance
- Smooth spring physics for natural motion
- Improved threshold and root margin for better timing

### **Hover Effects**
- All interactive elements have scale, glow, or shadow effects
- Green glow effects matching brand color (#13ef96)
- Smooth transitions with spring physics

### **Spring Physics**
- Natural motion using framer-motion spring animations
- Consistent stiffness (100-400) and damping (10-20) values
- Smooth, bouncy feel without being overwhelming

### **Staggered Timing**
- Elements animate sequentially for visual hierarchy
- 0.2s delays between related elements
- Creates natural flow and guides user attention

### **Performance Optimized**
- Uses `whileInView` for efficient scroll animations
- `once: true` prevents unnecessary re-animations
- Proper cleanup with Intersection Observer

## ðŸš€ **How to Use**

1. **Start your dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open browser** and navigate to your local development URL
3. **Scroll through the page** to see scroll-triggered animations
4. **Hover over elements** to see interactive effects
5. **Click buttons** to see tap animations

## ðŸŽ¨ **Animation Utilities**

### **Custom Hooks**
- `useScrollAnimation()` - Handles intersection observer logic
- Configurable threshold and root margin

### **Animation Variants**
- `fadeSlideUp` - Main section entrance animation
- `slideFromLeft/Right` - Directional slide animations
- `slideLeftRotate/slideRightRotate` - Reviews with rotation
- `hoverGlow` - Button hover with green glow
- `hoverRotateScale` - Card hover with rotation and scale
- `reviewHover` - Enhanced review card hover effects
- `reviewStagger` - Staggered timing for review animations

### **Spring Configuration**
```typescript
// Standard spring
{
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 120,
  damping: 20,
  mass: 1
}

// Smooth spring for delicate animations
{
  type: "spring",
  stiffness: 80,
  damping: 25,
  mass: 1
}
```
