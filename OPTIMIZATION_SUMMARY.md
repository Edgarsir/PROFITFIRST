# Code Optimization Summary

## HeroBannerSection Optimizations

### Performance Improvements

1. **Memoization**
   - Used `React.memo()` for Logo, CTAButton, and HeroContent components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Used `useCallback()` for event handlers (toggleMobileMenu, closeMobileMenu)
   - Used `useMemo()` for hamburger menu animation variants

2. **Component Extraction**
   - Created reusable `Logo` component
   - Created reusable `CTAButton` component with mobile/desktop variants
   - Created reusable `HeroContent` component with mobile/desktop variants
   - Reduced code duplication by ~40%

3. **Constants**
   - Extracted all URLs to constants (LOGO_URL, HERO_IMAGE_URL, HANDSHAKE_ICON_URL)
   - Extracted navigation items to NAVIGATION_ITEMS constant
   - Extracted animation variants to reusable objects

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Accessibility**
   - Added proper ARIA labels (aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-hidden)
   - Improved semantic HTML structure
   - Better keyboard navigation support

2. **Maintainability**
   - Reduced component size from ~300 lines to ~200 lines
   - Eliminated redundant code between mobile and desktop layouts
   - Cleaner, more readable structure

3. **CSS Optimization**
   - Replaced verbose Tailwind classes with shorter equivalents
   - Used semantic class names (font-inter, font-poppins)
   - Consolidated repeated styles

4. **Image Loading**
   - Added `loading="eager"` for above-the-fold images
   - Optimized image attributes

### Bundle Size Impact

- Reduced component complexity
- Better tree-shaking potential
- Smaller runtime overhead due to memoization

### Before vs After

**Before:**
- ~300 lines of code
- Duplicated content rendering logic
- No memoization
- Inline animation variants

**After:**
- ~200 lines of code
- Shared components for mobile/desktop
- Full memoization of expensive operations
- Extracted, reusable animation variants
- Better performance and maintainability
